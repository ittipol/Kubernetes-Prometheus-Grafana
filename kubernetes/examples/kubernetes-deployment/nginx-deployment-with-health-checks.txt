livenessProbe: The liveness probe checks whether the container is still alive. It uses an HTTP GET request to the / path on port 80 of the container. If the probe fails, K8s will restart the container.
readinessProbe: The readiness probe checks whether the container is ready to serve traffic. It also uses an HTTP GET request to the / path on port 80 of the container. If the probe fails, the container is marked as not ready, and K8s wonâ€™t send traffic to it.
